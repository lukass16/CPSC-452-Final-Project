A novel approach to 3D shape generation using a VAE-like network that leverages layers from the Point Net++ architecture as an encoder network and a DeepSDF-inspired decoder network.

The model implementation is in `final_model.py`, and the training procedure can be found in `pointnet_sdfvae_simple.ipynb`. Also see `working_model.pth` for a trained model.
